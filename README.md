# SWStarhips
We want to know for all SW star ships, to cover a given distance, how many stops for resupply are required.

The application will take as input a distance in mega lights (MGLT).

The output should be a collection of all the star ships and the total amount of stops required to make the distance between the planets.

## Getting Started

This project has two ways to execute and see the result. 
1) Executing a .exe that will run and show the result in a console prompt (made in .Net).
2) Executing a website that will run in your browser (made the backend in .Net and the frontend in Angular).

Install dependencies with
```
npm install
```
